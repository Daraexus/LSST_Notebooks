This repository contains the developped notebooks for the PhD project: "Astronomical image processing from large all-sky photometric surveys for the detection and the measurement of transients". These IPython Notebook are being developped for the LSST using Stack as base. Most of them contain tests of pipeline assembly for Image Coaddition, Image Subtraction and Astronomical Source Detection.
